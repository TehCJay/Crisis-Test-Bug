EVTTITLENARRATIVE1;The Crisis of the Confederation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCNARRATIVE1;An economic golden age grinds toward standstill. The previously inexorable march of imperialistic progress has been stamped out, stalled, or cut at the stem within the civil reaches of space. Even now, pretenders and rival ideologies march to war against our colonial masters, threatening mankind's ascendancy among the stars. Entire systems answer the rally to arms, each for their own benefit, bent on imposing will onto the masses just as the father did unto them.\n\nIn the time of the old guard, corporate entities acted with impunity. Their influence within government rank was unmatched, able to bend the rule of law at a whim in the name of a bottom line. It was not unheard of during this age to hear of corporate shock troopers and inter-corporate rivalries that put entire systems in danger. And amidst this chaos, sedition ran wild throughout mankind's stellar holdings. Opportunists and revolutionaries bid their time, and rose nearly as one to overthrow the negligent and indifferent oppressors.\n\nSome call this the end, a glimpse into a war-stricken future where everyman declares autonomy in the name of unproven doctrines and belief without foundation. Others know it as righteous justice, for the old guard had known their burgeoning share of scandal and abuse of power.\n\n\nYou know it as the Crisis of the Confederation..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLENARRATIVE100;The Coalition Triumphant!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCNARRATIVE100;Glory to the many, the oppressors overcome!\n\nTogether they have stood, these breakaway heroes and vandals, against a common tyranny. And though they may not agree on the length of the hour, the strength of a soul, or the distribution of a toothbrush, most have cast aside their colonial masters so that they might engineer new fates. In this time of uncertainty and disarray, the galaxy waits with bated breath as political power levels and vacuums become filled. This peace, hard fought, ushers in new challenges in every stata of society across the civil galaxy.\n\nFor now, we have much to look forward to on harvest day, during tax season, and whilst floating idly through the sea of stars. Every meal shared with family and every listless stare can be savored sweetly, knowing that justice had prevailed even in the deep unknown. With our freedom comes realization, as we may never turn back the clock.\n\nAnd through it all, some sense of unease lingers still. Where will we go from here? Can we truly be our own keepers in this hollow dark?\n\n\nOnly time will tell..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANARRATIVE100;Damn uppity colonials.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBNARRATIVE100;Freedom!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCNARRATIVE100;Hope they don't crack down now...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDNARRATIVE100;Thank God its over.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLENARRATIVE101;An Uneasy Stalemate;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCNARRATIVE101;The conflict is over, for now.\n\nAll partied with independence have fought valiantly in the depths of space and on the ground, casting off yokes wherever they could. And though they fought valiantly, not all will share this new and uncertain peace. The Confederation is shorn, with a treaty hammered out to mark a simplistic ceasefire with these new states. And though some do celebrate, they do so with trepidation. How long until the Confederation strikes out, bent on a lawful reclamation of old territories?\n\nWithout the Military State of Jion and the Directorate of Tarka, independence becomes that much harder to maintain. And though few will weep for these military juntas and callous dictatorships, their vessels had proved valuable to the war effort.\n\n\nThe length of the peace it anyone's game. But conflict is inevitable, and all know this in their heart of hearts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANARRATIVE101;It could be worse...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBNARRATIVE101;One day we shall all be free!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCNARRATIVE101;Hope they don't crack down now...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDNARRATIVE101;Thank God its over.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLENARRATIVE102;Victory Parade.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCNARRATIVE102;All is well, from rim to core!\n\nRebels and raiders, opportunists and pretenders had raised their flag against the great nation that is the Confederacy. Now, loyalist boots march over most worlds in civil space, bringing with them the law and order so bravely afforded to them by centuries of progress on our shared cradle world. With a house in order, mankind can look forward with singular purpose and vision between shared stars and worlds of plenty. A universe led by the legal distribution of power, and the mediation of strong and longsighted rule.\n\nThe President had this to say.\n"We each look out and see the stars, right there for the taking, for the material betterment of all. But some of us looked down, looked across to our shared family and thought to themselves that this was their moment to cause chaos and panic. They assumed that if our foundation were badly shaken, we would topple like so many blocks. But I am proud to announce that they proved our inalienable right to the cosmos! Rather than bend, and eventually break, we held fast against envy, greed, and ultimate dissolution. We proved the strength of our core beyond a doubt, that we are capable of so much more than petty grievances and make-belief."\n\nIn the wake of war, our leaders wear the mask of triumphant order. But beneath the exterior of assurances, many are uncertain. If the Confederation can be so disturbed, could it happen again? Even now, economies are slow to recover from conflict, and many systems lie in disarray after far-reaching battles. And while the war may be officially over, the hearts of men are so rarely stilled.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTANARRATIVE102;Victory for the Motherworld!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBNARRATIVE102;One day we shall come back...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBCARRATIVE102;Hope they don't crack down now...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTDNARRATIVE102;Thank God its over.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
