shangri_la_class_yacht_desc;A luxury yacht first laid down in 2954, the Shangri La class is an opulent palace in the sky, heavily associated with the late Confederate ruling class and the very symbol of their decadence. Her lavishly appointed ballrooms are sure to make an impression.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
calico_class_heavy_freighter;Calico-class Heavy Freighter;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
calico_class_heavy_freighter_desc;The first Calico-class heavy freighter was laid down in 2845, but her incredibly modular design, allowing extensive customization, made her an enduring fixture of the spacelanes through the end of the Confederate era. Many such freighters were actually "Q-ships", modified to conceal a surprisingly formidable battery of weapons.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
bishamonten_class_dreadnought;Bishamonten-class Dreadnought;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
bishamonten_class_dreadnought_desc;The Bishamonten-class dreadnought, first laid down at the Olympus Shipyards in 2992, was the largest and most powerful ship ever fielded by the Confederate Space Command.

ssf_59_dao_starfighter_desc;The SSF-59 "Dao" Starfighter emerged from its prototype phase in 2997, just in time for the Crisis of the Confederation.

commission_a_corvette_decision;Commission a Corvette;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

commission_a_freighter_decision;Commission a Q-ship;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
commission_a_freighter_decision_desc;A Q-ship is a fast ship with concealed weaponry, which can pass for a civilian freighter on sensors. The perfect tool for spymasters and pirates alike.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
commission_a_dreadnought_decision;Commission a Dreadnought;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCCOTCARTIFACT1002;Your late [GetFromRelation] had commissioned a new ship, and as [From.GetHerHis] heir, that commission should pass to you.
